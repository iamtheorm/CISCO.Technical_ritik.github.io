Ans : Internet Protocol (IP) addresses comprise numbers separated by several dots. IP addresses allow individuals to identify their locations easily, it also makes it easy to locate and send data to internet-connected devices, wherever they are.


 IPv4 v/s IPv6
 
IPv4 is composed of 32-bit address length & IPv6 is composed of 128-bit address length. 

IPv4 consists of approximately 4 billion addresses & IPv6 addressing consists of 320 undecillion addresses.

IPv4 address is numerically based with 4 fields separated by a dot (.) & IPv6 address is alphanumeric based consisting of 8 fields separated by a colon (:).

In the case of IPv4 addressing no encryption or authentication services are initiated & IPv6 provides proper encryption and authentication services for the address.



b. What do you think is the role of content in building and promoting a community, such as the CISCO Community?

It also helps solve problems, promotes the community, and gathers feedback for continuous improvement. In essence, content is vital for community growth and success. The right content will always get attention by people because when people can understand the idea, goals, motives and for what cause the community is working, the people can connect easily and start seeing themselves as part of the community which creates a sense of teamwork, mutual respect for every member, gives them the idea of purpose to fulfill which leads to growth and success of the community in which every single member is equally thankful for their contribution.
